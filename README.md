##Architecture and Design Choices

1. I have used Provider package for state management to manage application state.
2. I have also seperated code on the basis of its function namely UI, State, Model, Data.
3. Fetched data from a backend API to ensure scalability.
4. At first I wrote the whole UI and other functions in just main.dart thinking it will be a small implementation. But however, later applied state management and segregated code on the basis of funcationality.
